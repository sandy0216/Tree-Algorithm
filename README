# Tree-Algorithm

This is README file for the final project of 2021 CUDA parallel programming course
Author : Huai-Hsuan Chiu
Date   : June, 2021
HOW TO COMPILE:
=====
Simply type :
	make
=====
HOW TO RUN:
Simply type :
	./tree -CPU ./param	// For using CPU only
or
	./tree -GPU ./param	// For using GPU+CPU
=====
FILE:
tree	Execution file of this project
param	Runtime parameters of when running.
	boxsize	: Boundary of the code, in code unit
	n	: Total particle numbers
	theta	: Parameter of tree algorithm, see the report in doc/
	dt	: Time step
	endtime	: End time of the simulation
	endstep : End step of the simulation (No use yet)
	record	: Record the result every 'record' steps
	( The following are settings for GPU, see how to run the code )
	nx	: How many subregion in x direction (suggested to be power of 2)
	ny	: How many subregion in y direction (suggested to be power of 2)
	tx	: Threads per block in x direction (suggested to be power of 2)
	ty	: Threads per block in y direction (suggested to be power of 2)
	bx	: Blocks per grid in x direction (suggested to be power of 2)
	by	: Blocks per grid in y direction (suggested to be power of 2)
